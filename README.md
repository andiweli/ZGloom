# Instructions

## How to play

Gloom was made freely available by its developers [here](https://github.com/earok/GloomAmiga/archive/master.zip). Download, unzip the files and move the ZGloom binary and libs inside the uncompressed directory before run it. You can find the game files on the web or in the above directory ``gamefiles`` just extract the selected game inside the ZGloom folder so it looks like this (with example Gloom Deluxe as game):

```
ZGloom.exe
libxmp.dll
SDL2.dll
SDL2_mixer.dll
maps (dir)
misc (dir)
objs (dir)
pics (dir)
sfxs (dir)
txts (dir)
```

## Default Controls

Cursors, left alt to strafe, left ctrl to fire. F1 skips level. F12 toggles fullscreen. PrintScreen dumps a bitmap. Escape pauses the action and shows the menu. The extended menu has more options than the original game and port. Now you have additional filters like Vignette, Film grain and Scanlines. Also changing values works with arrow keys left and right.

## In-game music

ZGloom can now add in-game music using any module that XMP can play. Put the mods in the sfxs folder and add "song_blitz.mod" or whatever the module name is to the script. Multiple song_ commands are allowed, allowing per-level music.

# License

Dunno. [The Gloom source release](https://github.com/earok/GloomAmiga) says only the .s and .bb2 files are open source, but the Gloom executable bakes in some maths lookup tables (but then, they are generated by the .bb2 files), bullet and sparks graphics, and 
the title screen for Classic Gloom. I probably won't add the latter and just display the Black Magic image, or something.
